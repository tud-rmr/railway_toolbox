# Railway Toolbox for Matlab/Simulink

This is a collection of Matlab functions, simulink blocks, scripts etc., that are useful to develop railway localization and mapping methods. It contains functionalities all around creating single railway tracks, whole railway networks and working with IMU and GPS sensor data.

## Folder Structure

- *Libraries*: Simulink blocks
- *Tools*: Matlab functions
- *_matlab_helperFcns*: External Matlab functions
- *_simulink_helperFcns*: External Simulink blocks

## Usage

1. Clone repository and add it to Matlab path
2. Use scripts, functions, etc. for your purposes
   - Each function contains a short descriptions explaining how to use it. Often there is also a subfolder called *Test* containing at least one example on how to use the function.
   - Simulink blocks should automatically be detected when opening Simulink. After that you should see a section "Railway Toolbox" in the Simulink Library Browser. If not try to refresh by pressing F5.
